# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PROJECT:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Visualization
3. Critical Thinking
4. Problem Solving.

# DATA SOURCING:

I downloaded all the datasets from kaggle to my Excel workbook before importing Excel files into my Jupiter Notebook. I cleaned the datas then performed analysis to help me achieve my project objectives.

# DATA TRANSFORMATION/CLEANING:
The three projects was not in a clean format so i had to clean the data sets by carrying the followng process;

1. I checked the general information for each of them
2. For 80 Cereals dataset i renamed the columns with short forms
3. I checked for missing values. The customer personality dataset had 24 missing values in the Income coloumn so i cleared the missing values by filling the missing rows with the average income.
4. I also checked for duplicated values
5. I performed descriptive analysis for each of them to check for outliers

# ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:
I carried out an Exploratory Data Analysis on each of the project in order to be able to find solutions to the problems. I chose to create a simple and easy-to-understand visuals. I used simple colors for my visuals from both matplotlibrary and seaborn. Each visuals has a title and labels for easy identification. I also included some insights at the end of each visuals to help the reader understand the observations from each visualizations.
